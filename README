chromesthesia
  a form of synesthesia in which nonvisual stimulation
  results in the experience of color sensations.

chromesthesia is a realtime sound visualizer that can generate
real life physical light shows as well as digital on-screen visuals.

chromesthesia is a work in progress and created mostly for my own
amusement.  And I don't really know what I'm doing, most of this
is just trial and error :)
