chromesthesia
  a form of synesthesia in which nonvisual stimulation
  results in the experience of color sensations.

chromesthesia is a realtime sound analyzer and semi-beat detection
system that generates DMX output via Artnet to light rigs based
on the sound playing.
The beat-dection is non-predictive and reacts directly to stimula.

chromesthesia is a work in progress and created mostly for my own
amusement.  And I don't really know what I'm doing, most of this
is just trial and error :)
